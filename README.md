In this notebook, we learn how to use sklearn to implement preprocessing steps on an uncleaned dataset.
The Uncleaned Laptop Price dataset is a collection of laptop product listings scraped from an online e-commerce website. The dataset includes information about various laptop models, such as their brand, screen size, processor, memory, storage capacity, operating system, and price. However, the dataset is uncleaned, meaning that it contains missing values, inconsistent formatting, and other errors that need to be addressed before the data can be used for analysis or modeling.
The dataset contains both categorical and numerical variables, with the majority of variables being categorical, including brand, model name, screen resolution, processor type, and operating system. Some numerical variables include screen size, memory, and storage capacity. The target variable in the dataset is the price, which is a continuous variable.
The dataset contains over 1,300 laptop listings, making it a reasonably sized dataset for analysis and modeling. The dataset may be useful for machine learning projects related to predicting the price of a laptop based on its specifications. However, before using the dataset, it would be necessary to clean and preprocess the data to address the inconsistencies and missing values.
